## Real-Time Air Quality Monitoring Network, 2015-16, IIT Bombay

{{% fluid_img src="/img/work/20150914_233922.jpg" caption="Building Real-Time Air Quality Monitors" %}}

I developed a low-cost air quality monitoring network of sensors during my undergraduate thesis. This project was funded by [Development Impact Lab, UC Berkeley](http://dil.berkeley.edu/technology-portfolio/dil-explore/) and was done under the guidance of [Prof. Bhaskaran Raman](http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/silmaril/br/doku.php), CSE Dept., IIT Bombay. I collaborated with [Ph.D. students in UC Berkeley](http://bets.cs.berkeley.edu/) and Professors in [Environmental Science](http://www.cese.iitb.ac.in/people/facinfo.php?id=vsethi) and [Geographic Information Systems](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jitendra-shah-07b2094/) at IIT Bombay across different phases of the project. During the course of the project, we built hardware and drivers to measure and transmit data, backend server exposing secured APIs to record and serve data, applications built over these APIs for consuming the generated data and lastly, we designed validation experiments to compare our sensors alongside the standard monitors used by the government agencies.

[Dylos Sensors](http://www.dylosproducts.com/ornodcproair.html) were used with [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-1-model-b/) and [GPRS board](http://www.rhydolabz.com/wireless-gsm-gprs-c-130_185/sim-900-gsmgprs-module-p-969.html). The drivers on the raspberry pi were built over python and [sMAP](https://github.com/SoftwareDefinedBuildings/smap), implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/dhruti96shah/AirQualityMonitoring). The backend APIs were built using [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) over [Berkeley Tree Database](https://github.com/BTrDB) and [Giles](https://github.com/gtfierro/giles2). The implementation of the backend can be found [here](https://github.com/shankari/Real-Time-Air-Quality-Sensoring-Network).

The project was presented to then Hon. Minister of Environment, Mr. Prakash Javadekar via [IIT Bombay Global Business Forum 2015](http://iitbaa-gbf.com/). Presentations, Reports and Articles published in relation to the project are listed below:
