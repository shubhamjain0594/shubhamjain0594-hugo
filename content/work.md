## Real-Time Air Quality Monitoring Network

I developed a low-cost air quality monitoring network of sensors. This project was funded by [Development Impact Lab, UC Berkeley](http://dil.berkeley.edu/technology-portfolio/dil-explore/). The project spanned across 3 phases

- Development of hardware for collection of data and transmission to cloud. [Dylos Sensors](http://www.dylosproducts.com/ornodcproair.html) were used with [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-1-model-b/) and [GPRS board](http://www.rhydolabz.com/wireless-gsm-gprs-c-130_185/sim-900-gsmgprs-module-p-969.html). The drivers on the raspberry pi were built over python and [sMAP](https://github.com/SoftwareDefinedBuildings/smap), implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/dhruti96shah/AirQualityMonitoring).
