Artificial Neural Networks are inspired by some of the "computations" that occur in human brains—real neural networks. In the past 10 years, much progress has been made with Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning due to accelerated computer power (GPUs), Open Source coding libraries that are being leveraged, and in-the-moment debates and corroborations via social media. Hugo Larochelle shares his observations of what’s been made possible with the underpinnings of Deep Learning.

Hugo Larochelle is a Research Scientist at Twitter and an Assistant Professor at the Université de Sherbrooke (UdeS). Before 2011, he spent two years in the machine learning group at the University of Toronto, as a postdoctoral fellow under the supervision of Geoffrey Hinton. He obtained his Ph.D. at Université de Montréal, under the supervision of Yoshua Bengio. He is the recipient of two Google Faculty Awards. His professional involvement includes associate editor for the IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI), member of the editorial board of the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research (JAIR) and program chair for the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) of 2015, 2016 and 2017.
