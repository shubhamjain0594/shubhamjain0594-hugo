OPAL project presents a practical and open-sourced query-based platform for privacy-preserving large scale location data analytics. The [project website](https://opalproject.org) provides more details on the project. At Imperial, I worked with Axel Oehmichen, Andrea Gadotti and Yves-Alexandre to build the system. The open-sourced code can be found [here](https://github.com/OPAL-Project). The [paper](https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/handle/10044/1/75561) describing and evaluating the platform has been published at [IEEE BigData 2019](https://bigdataieee.org/BigData2019/AcceptedPapers.html). The platform was deployed in Colombia and Senegal with the help of partners in those countries.
