I am Shubham Jain, working as a Research Assistant at [Computational Privacy Group](https://cpg.doc.ic.ac.uk/), [Imperial College London](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/). Prior to this I was working at [Qure.ai](http://qure.ai) as an AI Scientist and Founding Member of the team. I graduated in Computer Science from [IIT Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in/) in 2016. 

This blog is to record and share my learnings, some good blog posts I come across and my experiences. I like building things, reading, traveling and watching sports. You can get in touch with me through [twitter](https://twitter.com/shubhamjain0594) or [github](https://github.com/shubhamjain0594).
